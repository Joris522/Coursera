Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course from John's Hopkins University.

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
- Downloads and unzips the dataset
- Loads the activity labels and features
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and the standard deviation
- merges the training datasets and test data sets
- adds descriptive variable names
- creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- writes the tidy dataset to the file tidy.txt.
