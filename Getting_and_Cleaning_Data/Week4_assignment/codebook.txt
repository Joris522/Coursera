Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt computed from run_analysis.R.

Variables
- activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken (see "Activity Labels" for a description of each of the 6 activities and values)
- subject - The ID of the test subject (30 total subjects)
- measurement - The measured feature
- mean - The mean of the measured feature for the corresponding activity and subject

Activity Labels
- WALKING (value 1): Subject was walking during the test
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): Subject was walking up a staircase during the test
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): Subject was walking down a staircase during the test
- SITTING (value 4): Subject was sitting during the test
- STANDING (value 5): Subject was standing during the test
- LAYING (value 6): Subject was laying down during the test

The mean of the following measurements were computed and stored in the mean column:
